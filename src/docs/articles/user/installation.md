# Installation

1. [Download the latest version installer](https://github.com/trylock/viewer/releases)
2. Optionally, click the `Options` button and choose another installation location. Otherwise, it will be installed in standard directories (`C:/Program Files x86` for 32 bit version, `C:/Program Files` for 64 bit version)
3. Click the `Install` button to start the installation.

The program will save application settings and other temporary files to the `%localappdata%/Viewer` folder. The default folder for query views is `%userprofile%/Documents/Viewer/Views`. 

> [!TIP]
> You can copy and paste these paths into the address bar in Windows File Explorer to find the folders.

## Reporting errors

You can report errors at the github [Issues](https://github.com/trylock/viewer/issues) page. If the program crashes, it will create a log file at `%userprofile%/Documents/Viewer/Viewer.log`. It would be appreciated if you included this file with the report. 

> [!WARNING]
> The log file can contain paths in your file system. If you're going to upload the file publicly, make sure it does not contain any information you'd not want to share.
